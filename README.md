Welcome to my GitHub repository, showcasing my skills in data extraction From Excel, transformation, loading, modeling, DAX writing, report building, and publishing using Power Query, Power View, and Power BI.

üîç Extract data: I received the data from the client in Excel format, which served as the initial source for analysis.

‚óæ Transform data: Using Power Query, I meticulously cleaned the data by removing null and duplicate values, rectifying spelling errors, and ensuring consistent data types.

‚óæ Load data: The transformed data was then loaded into Power View, where it became ready for in-depth analysis.

‚óæ Data Modeling: To effectively analyze and visualize the data, I implemented a robust data modeling process, creating a logical structure that laid the foundation for meaningful insights.

‚óæ Writing DAX: Utilizing the power of Data Analysis Expressions (DAX), I refined the data even further by creating calculated measures and calculated columns. This enabled advanced analysis and facilitated comprehensive insights.

‚óæ Report Building: With a focus on user-friendliness and intuitiveness, I built a captivating dashboard. Through visually appealing reports and interactive visualizations, I provided an immersive experience for data exploration.

‚óæ Publish Report: The finalized dashboard was published on Power BI Service, granting the client easy access to the data and insights. Additionally, I delivered a comprehensive report of insights and recommendations, offering actionable suggestions.

Throughout this repository, you'll find examples of my expertise in data manipulation, modeling, and visualization using Power Query, Power View, and Power BI. Each project highlights my dedication to delivering accurate, insightful, and user-friendly reports.

Feel free to explore my work, provide feedback, and connect with me for further collaborations. Let's leverage data to unlock valuable insights and drive informed decision-making.
